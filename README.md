Aim: To analyze the relative popularity of programming languages over time based on Stack Overflow data.

Key questions to answer:
1.	Which is the most popular programming language?
2.	Which programming languages are growing and which ones are shrinking?
3.	How has the popularity of R changed over time?
4.	How has the popularity of R, ggplot2 and dplyr changed over time?
5.	Exploring curiosity: How has the popularity of android, ios and windows-phones changed over time?

Key tasks:
1.	Loading libraries like readr, dplyr, ggplot2.
2.	Creating tables.
3.	Creating new column with calculation of number of questions per tag out of total questions.
4.	Using filter, piping, group_by, summarize, arrange.
5.	Data visualization using line plot.

Insights:
1.	Javascript is the most popular programming language.
2.	C# has shrunk while Python has grown immensely in popularity.
3.	R has been steadily growing over the years.
4.	R is very popular in comparison to ggplot2 and dplyr.
5.	The most popular has been android, then ios and windows-phone.
